# PixelFlow
I created this site while learning web development and design as a way to showcase my skills and projects. The website is designed to be simple, clean and user-friendly, with a focus on showcasing my work and the technologies I've used. Here, you'll find a range of projects I've worked on, from small personal projects to group projects in my coursework. I hope you enjoy browsing the site and learning more about my work. This website is hosted on Github, feel free to visit my Github profile for more information.
